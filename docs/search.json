Atmospheric correction is a crucial step in remote sensing image processing aimed at removing the influence of the atmosphere on the image, thus obtaining more accurate surface reflectance information. The primary goal of atmospheric correction is to eliminate atmospheric scattering and absorption effects to quantify surface features more accurately (Jensen, 2007).\nDue to the complexity of the topics discussed this week, I utilized mind mapping to record the key points of the lectures."

However, they are crucial for later image processing and are key steps in subsequent analysis. If correct image processing is not performed from the beginning, it could lead to ineffective or erroneous analysis in the end.\nThe mathematical formulas for corrections may appear quite complex, but fortunately, each satellite comes with a user manual. This manual provides the correction formulas that can be referenced and utilized during the correction process. With the deepening of research, correction algorithms are continuously iterated and updated, resulting in improved image quality.\nIn practical operations, PCA analysis requires a large amount of computation and is very time-consuming. This week’s operations are still conducted in R, but I am also curious about how image processing is done in GEE."

Currently, Shandong Province has launched the Dimensions 03/04 satellites, which are used for land surveys, geographic mapping, natural disaster monitoring, urban planning, and other fields. These satellites have relatively high spatial resolution and data acquisition capabilities, which can be used to monitor changes in arable land and protection efforts. The next step is to establish a map database and perform pre-processing tasks such as object classification and feature extraction. Utilizing the features of buildings in remote sensing images, such as shape, color, texture, etc., combined with local building plans, land-use policies, and other information, rules for extracting illegal construction features can be formulated to automatically or semi-automatically identify illegal construction. Finally, based on the extracted illegal construction features and verification data, machine learning, deep learning, and other methods can be used to establish a monitoring model to achieve automatic identification and monitoring of illegal construction."

In class, we discussed how Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) distribution significantly affects Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), identifying urban green spaces, and monitoring forests and illegal logging as examples. One machine learning method for classification is Classification and Regression Trees (CART), where classification trees are used to classify data into two or more discrete categories. Regression trees are used to predict a continuous dependent variable. Gini impurity is a measure used in decision tree algorithms for classification tasks. It quantifies the impurity or uncertainty of a dataset by calculating the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. However, this model can also suffer from overfitting. To avoid overfitting, techniques such as pruning, limiting maximum depth, setting minimum samples for splitting, setting minimum samples for leaf nodes, limiting the number of features considered for splitting, and using cross-validation can be employed to reduce the risk of overfitting in decision tree models."

    "text": "1.1 Summary\n\n1.1.1 Remote sensing\nThis week mainly introduced the principles of remote sensing. Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object (Schowengerdt, 2007).\nRemote sensing can be divided into passive remote sensing and active remote sensing. In passive remote sensing, sensors detect and measure the radiation emitted or reflected by objects or surfaces. In active remote sensing, sensors emit their own radiation and measure the response from the objects or surfaces being observed.\n\n\n1.1.2 Band\nIn remote sensing, a “band” refers to a specific range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum that is used to acquire data about the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. Each band corresponds to a particular portion of the spectrum, such as visible light, infrared, or microwave radiation. Each band provides unique information about the properties of the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. By combining data from multiple bands, remote sensing analysts can create composite images or datasets that offer a comprehensive view of the area being observed, enabling a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and other fields.\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolutions\nRemotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions: Spatial, Spectral, Temporal, Radiometric (Jensen, 2007).\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest discernible feature in an image. It is usually expressed in terms of pixels per unit area or ground area covered by each pixel.\nSpectral Resolution: the range of wavelengths or bands of the electromagnetic spectrum that a remote sensing system can detect.\nRadiometric Resolution: the sensitivity of a remote sensing system to variations in electromagnetic radiation intensity.\nTemporal Resolution: the frequency at which data is collected over the same area.\nRemote sensing has multiple applications: land cover data set, Urban / green space coverage and accessibility, Pollution studies, Illegal logging, Forest fires, Temperature studies, Flooding / disaster response / building footprints."

Urban heat island (UHI) refers to a localized area within a city or metropolitan area that experiences significantly higher temperatures compared to its surrounding rural areas. It primarily stems from more defined dark surfaces and less vegetation in urban areas. The urban heat island poses challenges to residents’ health, energy supply, economic development, and other aspects.\nCurrently, global policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions are being implemented to control global warming. The UN has developed the Beat the Heat Handbook to provide guidance measures for cities worldwide. During the class, various UHI reduction activities in different cities were introduced. Planting trees is one of the initiatives adopted by various cities, and remote sensing can assist us in identifying areas suitable for greening.\nRemote sensing obtains surface temperatures through various sensors and techniques. One of them is using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing. It utilizes the thermal radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface to acquire temperature information. Thermal infrared sensors measure thermal radiation in different wavelength ranges and infer surface."

The new method retrieves the ancillary information on the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and total water vapor (TWV) from the multi-spectral information. (Wang, 2019 )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2.2 ocean colour\nSiregar, V P and colleagues compared the results of object-based image classification from images that underwent atmospheric correction using the FLAASH method with those that did not. Their findings indicate that atmospheric correction with FLAASH enhances the visualization and reflectance patterns of shallow water objects, which is essential for the accurate classification and mapping of benthic habitats.
