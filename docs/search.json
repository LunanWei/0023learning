Atmospheric correction is a crucial step in remote sensing image processing aimed at removing the influence of the atmosphere on the image, thus obtaining more accurate surface reflectance information. The primary goal of atmospheric correction is to eliminate atmospheric scattering and absorption effects to quantify surface features more accurately (Jensen, 2007).\nDue to the complexity of the topics discussed this week, I utilized mind mapping to record the key points of the lectures."

However, they are crucial for later image processing and are key steps in subsequent analysis. If correct image processing is not performed from the beginning, it could lead to ineffective or erroneous analysis in the end.\nThe mathematical formulas for corrections may appear quite complex, but fortunately, each satellite comes with a user manual. This manual provides the correction formulas that can be referenced and utilized during the correction process. With the deepening of research, correction algorithms are continuously iterated and updated, resulting in improved image quality.\nIn practical operations, PCA analysis requires a large amount of computation and is very time-consuming. This week’s operations are still conducted in R, but I am also curious about how image processing is done in GEE."

Currently, Shandong Province has launched the Dimensions 03/04 satellites, which are used for land surveys, geographic mapping, natural disaster monitoring, urban planning, and other fields. These satellites have relatively high spatial resolution and data acquisition capabilities, which can be used to monitor changes in arable land and protection efforts.\nThe next step is to establish a map database and perform pre-processing tasks such as object classification and feature extraction. Utilizing the features of buildings in remote sensing images, such as shape, color, texture, etc., combined with local building plans, land-use policies, and other information, rules for extracting illegal construction features can be formulated to automatically or semi-automatically identify illegal construction.\nFinally, based on the extracted illegal construction features and verification data, machine learning, deep learning, and other methods can be used to establish a monitoring model to achieve automatic identification and monitoring of illegal construction."

Additionally, since the color of building roofs can lead to misidentification based solely on color recognition, it may be necessary to combine material recognition to more accurately identify illegal buildings.\nAlthough SIBI has enhanced China’s central capacity to uncover illegal farmland conversion and weakened local governments’ abilities to conceal such activities, its impact on illegal farmland conversion is limited since it is merely a technical tool. Improvements in the governance structure of land inspection have also contributed to deterring illegal farmland conversion (Zhong, 2014)."

In class, we discussed how Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) distribution significantly affects Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), identifying urban green spaces, and monitoring forests and illegal logging as examples. One machine learning method for classification is Classification and Regression Trees (CART), where classification trees are used to classify data into two or more discrete categories. Regression trees are used to predict a continuous dependent variable. Gini impurity is a measure used in decision tree algorithms for classification tasks. It quantifies the impurity or uncertainty of a dataset by calculating the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. However, this model can also suffer from overfitting. To avoid overfitting, techniques such as pruning, limiting maximum depth, setting minimum samples for splitting, setting minimum samples for leaf nodes, limiting the number of features considered for splitting, and using cross-validation can be employed to reduce the risk of overfitting in decision tree models."

Remote sensing is the acquisition of information about an object or phenomenon without making physical contact with the object (Schowengerdt, 2007).\nRemote sensing can be divided into passive remote sensing and active remote sensing. In passive remote sensing, sensors detect and measure the radiation emitted or reflected by objects or surfaces. In active remote sensing, sensors emit their own radiation and measure the response from the objects or surfaces being observed.\n\n\n1.1.2 Band\nIn remote sensing, a “band” refers to a specific range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum that is used to acquire data about the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. Each band corresponds to a particular portion of the spectrum, such as visible light, infrared, or microwave radiation. Each band provides unique information about the properties of the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. By combining data from multiple bands, remote sensing analysts can create composite images or datasets that offer a comprehensive view of the area being observed, enabling a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and other fields.\n\n\n1.1.3 Resolutions\nRemotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions: Spatial, Spectral, Temporal, Radiometric (Jensen, 2007).\nSpatial Resolution: the size of the smallest discernible feature in an image. It is usually expressed in terms of pixels per unit area or ground area covered by each pixel.\nSpectral Resolution: the range of wavelengths or bands of the electromagnetic spectrum that a remote sensing system can detect.\nRadiometric Resolution: the sensitivity of a remote sensing system to variations in electromagnetic radiation intensity.\nTemporal Resolution: the frequency at which data is collected over the same area.\nRemote sensing has multiple applications: land cover data set, Urban / green space coverage and accessibility, Pollution studies, Illegal logging, Forest fires, Temperature studies, Flooding / disaster response / building footprints."

    "text": "5.1 Summary\nThis week, I mainly focus on Heat Island, as well as Extracting temperature from satellite data. Urban heat island (UHI) refers to a localized area within a city or metropolitan area that experiences significantly higher temperatures compared to its surrounding rural areas. It primarily stems from more defined dark surfaces and less vegetation in urban areas. The urban heat island poses challenges to residents’ health, energy supply, economic development, and other aspects.\nCurrently, global policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions are being implemented to control global warming. The UN has developed the Beat the Heat Handbook to provide guidance measures for cities worldwide. During the class, various UHI reduction activities in different cities were introduced. Planting trees is one of the initiatives adopted by various cities, and remote sensing can assist us in identifying areas suitable for greening.\nRemote sensing obtains surface temperatures through various sensors and techniques. One of them is using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing. It utilizes the thermal radiation emitted from the Earth’s surface to acquire temperature information. Thermal infrared sensors measure thermal radiation in different wavelength ranges and infer surface."

    "text": "5.2 Application\n\n5.2.1 Practical\nIn landsat 8 SR_B. represents Surface Reflectance bands, ST_B.* represents Thermal bands. Thermal bands typically include one or more bands used to measure surface temperature, such as ST_B10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spatial resolution of MODIS is relatively low, typically ranging from 250 meters to 1 kilometer, making it suitable for monitoring large-scale surface temperature changes. Landsat, on the other hand, has a higher spatial resolution, typically ranging from 30 meters to 100 meters, making it suitable for monitoring surface temperature changes in smaller areas. MODIS has a higher temporal resolution, typically providing data daily, whereas Landsat has a lower temporal resolution, typically providing data every few days to weeks. Due to its higher temporal resolution and suitability for large-scale spatial resolution, MODIS is commonly used in fields such as global climate change monitoring, environmental monitoring, and weather forecasting. Landsat’s higher spatial resolution makes it more suitable for fine-scale surface temperature monitoring and surface feature identification, commonly used in areas such as land use/land cover change, urban planning, and resource management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Casa study:\nSaputra (2022) focused on the investigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Jakarta, Indonesia, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study utilized remote sensing imagery from Landsat 8 to extract land surface temperatures and employed various methodologies for calculating UHI, including radiance conversion, brightness temperature, land surface emissivity, and correlation analysis with COVID-19 case distributions."

Every city has a forecasted temperature, but for large cities, there can be temperature differences across different areas. By leveraging machine learning on remote sensing temperatures and forecasted temperatures, we can obtain more detailed temperature predictions for different regions within the city.\n\nUrban Planning\n\nI am also contemplating on urban planning. People have various orientations in urban plannin but currently, temperature is less considered in the initial design phase. Through machine learning, we can predict the future temperature of the built space after implementing different planning methods, in order to choose suitable methods to reduce the urban heat island effect.\n\nResearch use\n\nJust like what Saputra did, we can obtain urban temperature data through remote sensing and then analyze it together with other data.\n\nLimitations\n\nDespite the unparalleled advantages of satellite images to explore the SUHI. Remotely-sensed LST is completely different from air temperature in terms of observation principles and altitudes, which makes SUHI not directly comparable to air UHI. (Zhou, 2019)"
