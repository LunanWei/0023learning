However, they are crucial for later image processing and are key steps in subsequent analysis. If correct image processing is not performed from the beginning, it could lead to ineffective or erroneous analysis in the end. In practical operations, PCA analysis requires a large amount of computation and is very time-consuming. This week’s operations are still conducted in R, but I am also curious about how image processing is done in GE."

I chose the area of food security from the Universal Sustainable Development Goals (11.3.1, addresses land consumption to population growth as an indicator), as China is also implementing strict arable land protection strategies to ensure food security. At the same time, I selected the previously worked Jinan City as the research object for this week. According to the Land Protection Law, Jinan has formulated the Overall Land Use Plan for Jinan City, with yellow areas in the map designated as agricultural land."

Currently, Shandong Province has launched the Dimensions 03/04 satellites, which are used for land surveys, geographic mapping, natural disaster monitoring, urban planning, and other fields. These satellites have relatively high spatial resolution and data acquisition capabilities, which can be used to monitor changes in arable land and protection efforts. The next step is to establish a map database and perform pre-processing tasks such as object classification and feature extraction. Utilizing the features of buildings in remote sensing images, such as shape, color, texture, etc., combined with local building plans, land-use policies, and other information, rules for extracting illegal construction features can be formulated to automatically or semi-automatically identify illegal construction. Finally, based on the extracted illegal construction features and verification data, machine learning, deep learning, and other methods can be used to establish a monitoring model to achieve automatic identification and monitoring of illegal construction."

Additionally, since the color of building roofs can lead to misidentification based solely on color recognition, it may be necessary to combine material recognition to more accurately identify illegal buildings."

It is a public data catalog, compute infrastructure, geospatial APIs and an interactive app server.\nGoogle Earth Engine (GEE) offers several key advantages:\n\nMassive-scale geospatial processing. It contains planetary scale analysis and datasets which are provided by specialists, such as climate and weather.\nAccess to historical and near real-time satellite imagery and geospatial data. A wide range of open source satellite data such as Landsat, sentinel, High-Resolution Imagery, MODIS, etc. are available through GEE.\nAnalysis tools. What’s pretty amazing is that we can do all kinds of analyses like machine learning through Javascript coding, such as machine learning and statistical analysis capabilities for complex data interpretation.\nEfficiency and rapid processing capability. The computation runs on google’s servers, and we borrow resources from the cloud for the computation, so it’s very efficient."

I have explored the data that has already been processed and discovered that experts have conducted extensive research, including LCLU, drought, night light, crops, forest, fire information, etc. So I’m worried about what else I can do with it."

    "text": "9.1 Summary\nThis week I started performing classification operations in GEE. In class, we discussed how Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) distribution significantly affects Mean Annual Precipitation (MAP) and Land Surface Temperature (LST), identifying urban green spaces, and monitoring forests and illegal logging as examples. One machine learning method for classification is Classification and Regression Trees (CART), where classification trees are used to classify data into two or more discrete categories. Regression trees are used to predict a continuous dependent variable. Gini impurity is a measure used in decision tree algorithms for classification tasks. It quantifies the impurity or uncertainty of a dataset by calculating the probability of misclassifying a randomly chosen element if it were randomly labeled according to the distribution of labels in the dataset. However, this model can also suffer from overfitting. To avoid overfitting, techniques such as pruning, limiting maximum depth, setting minimum samples for splitting, setting minimum samples for leaf nodes, limiting the number of features considered for splitting, and using cross-validation can be employed to reduce the risk of overfitting in decision tree models."

    "text": "3.1 Summary\nNASA defines remote sensing as acquiring information from a distance.\nIn passive remote sensing, sensors detect and measure the radiation emitted or reflected by objects or surfaces. In active remote sensing, sensors emit their own radiation and measure the response from the objects or surfaces being observed.\nIn remote sensing, a “band” refers to a specific range of wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum that is used to acquire data about the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. Each band corresponds to a particular portion of the spectrum, such as visible light, infrared, or microwave radiation. Each band provides unique information about the properties of the Earth’s surface or atmosphere. By combining data from multiple bands, remote sensing analysts can create composite images or datasets that offer a comprehensive view of the area being observed, enabling a wide range of applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, urban planning, and other fields.\nApplications: land cover data set with 10m resolution (real time), Urban / green space coverage and accessibility, Pollution studies, Illegal logging, Forest fires, Temperature studies, Flooding / disaster response / building footprints\nPolarization\nRemotely sensed data and applications will vary based on the four resolutions: Spatial, Spectral, Temporal, Radiometric."
