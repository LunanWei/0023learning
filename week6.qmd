## Summary

Google Earth Engine is a cloud-based platform for planetary-scale environmental data analysis. It is a public data catalog, compute infrastructure, geospatial APIs and an interactive app server.

Google Earth Engine (GEE) offers several key advantages:

1.  Massive-scale geospatial processing. It contains planetary scale analysis and datasets which are provided by specialists, such as climate and weather.
2.  Access to historical and near real-time satellite imagery and geospatial data. A wide range of open source satellite data such as Landsat, sentinel, High-Resolution Imagery, MODIS, etc. are available through GEE.
3.  Analysis tools. What's pretty amazing is that we can do all kinds of analyses like machine learning through Javascript coding, such as machine learning and statistical analysis capabilities for complex data interpretation.
4.  Efficiency and rapid processing capability. The computation runs on google's servers, and we borrow resources from the cloud for the computation, so it's very efficient.

## Applications

### Practical

This week, I conducted some basic operations on Google Earth Engine (GEE), focusing on the Delhi region in India. My activities included adding points and polygons. I loaded Landsat satellite imagery and used vector administrative boundaries from GADM for cropping. Since I loaded multiple images, I synthesized them into a single image using the method of mean.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/image2.png')


knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/mean.png')


knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/point.png')


knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/pca.png')
```

### Case study: illegal waste disposal

Silvestri and Omri, emploied IKONOS satellite data to address the environmental challenges posed by uncontrolled landfills, particularly in areas experiencing rapid industrial growth. The method involves initial recognition using maximum likelihood classification, manual digitization of detected sites, and selection of the most likely lands using additional geographic and historical information.(Silvestri ,2008)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/classification.png')

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk6/landfill.png')

```

Global Plastic Watch (GPW) is a digital platform that maps the world\'s plastic pollution in near real-time using a unique combination of satellite imagery and artificial intelligence. The research employs a novel pipeline of neural networks(Pixel Spectrogram Classifier and Patch Classifier are used) that analyze spectral, spatial, and temporal data from Sentinel-2 satellites to detect plastic waste aggregations on land throughout Southeast Asia. This approach allows for the identification of plastic waste sites, monitoring waste site footprints over time, and generating metadata for each detected site.

## Reflection

GEE is very interesting as it integrates data, code editing, and existing algorithms. It saves me a lot of time by eliminating the need to download data, while also not occupying my storage space and computing resources. As a result, I can quickly explore and manipulate data. I have explored the data that has already been processed and discovered that experts have conducted extensive research, including LCLU, drought, night light, crops, forest, fire information, etc. So I'm worried about what else I can do with it.
