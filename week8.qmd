## Summary

### Lecture

This week I continuously learned classification, which include Object based image analysis (OBIA). In order to extract finer spatial information from imagery data than what is provided by the native spatial resolution of the sensor, we also use subpixel analysis. In the accuracy assessment part, we use confusion matrix. In a confusion matrix, each row represents the instances in an actual class, while each column represents the instances in a predicted class.

### Pracital

Following the practical requirements, after loading the city's data, I applied cloud masking to the Landsat dataset using the cloudMaskC2L7 function. Then, I extracted data for urban, grassland, bare soil, and forest from the image.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/true_color.png')
```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/unmixed.png')

```

Next, I computed the gradient and spectral gradient of the image and added them to the map.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/constrained.png')
```

Additionally, I conducted image segmentation using the KMeans and SNIC algorithms, and visualized the segmentation results on the map.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/kmeans.png')

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/spectural_gradient.png')
```

Furthermore, I calculated the standard deviation and NDVI of the image, and displayed the results on the map.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/stddev.png')

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/NDVI.png')

```

Finally, I merged the segmented image data with the classified data, performed classification training, and visualized the classification results on the map.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk8/reclassified.png')

```

## Application

## Reflection

-   Imposing these constraints can make the results of non-mixture analysis more physically meaningful and geographically realistic. The non-negativity constraint ensures that scores will not take on unreasonable negative values, while the unity constraint ensures that the sum of all scores is 1, representing the percentage distribution of land cover types within pixels. These constraints help improve the accuracy and interpretability of non-mixture analysis, making the results more closely aligned with actual geographical scenarios.

-   In spectral unmixing analysis, negative endmember fractions may occur due to several reasons: spectral similarity, spectral variability, noise effects, nonlinear mixing, and overfitting.

## Reference

## Dictionary

-   Sub pixel analysis. It determines the proportion or abundance of landcover per pixel.

-   Endmember: The spectral characteristics of pure land cover components constituting a mixed pixel.

-   Fractions: The fraction images obtained from unmixing, representing the fraction of each endmember in the mixture.

-   Sub-pixel: The situation in remote sensing imagery where individual pixels consist of multiple land cover types.

-   Unmixing: A remote sensing image processing technique aimed at decomposing the mixed spectral signatures within pixels into linear combinations of pure land cover spectra, or endmembers.

-   OBIA: Object Based Image Analysis. The ratio of the reflected electromagnetic radiation from a surface at different wavelengths.

-   Image Gradient: A commonly used image processing technique for detecting and highlighting edge and detail features in images. It determines whether a pixel belongs to an edge or to the interior of a region by computing the rate of change between its pixel value and those of its neighboring pixels.

-   Super Pixels: A commonly used image segmentation technique aimed at clustering adjacent pixels with similar properties into regions with unified characteristics.

-   Spectral Reflectance: The ratio of the reflected electromagnetic radiation from a surface at different wavelengths.

-   SNIC: Superpixels using N-Dimensional Iterative Clustering. The main idea of the SNIC algorithm is to simultaneously cluster pixels in both color and spatial domains.
