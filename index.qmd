Hi, I am Lunan. After completing my undergraduate studies in architecture, I joined the planning department in Jinan city. Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Urban Spatial Science at CASA. This document is intended to record my learning in remote sensing module. In my work, I have been involved in using remote sensing for monitoring illegal constructions and farmland protection. Additionally, I have learned that remote sensing can be utilized for guiding investments through land monitoring. I hope to explore the application of remote sensing technology in the field of smart cities through this module.

According to the course requirements, the main parts of the diary include Summary, Application, and Reflection. However, to better help me understand and remember the concepts, I have added an additional section called Dictionary to explain some unfamiliar words and concepts encountered, this section is only for personal use.
