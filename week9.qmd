## Summary

### SAR

A form of active data gathering, involves a sensor generating its own energy and subsequently measuring the energy reflected back following its interaction with the Earth's surface. Longer antenna means narrower beam and a higher resolution. While too long antenna is not practical for a satellite sensor in space. Therefore, multiple acquisitions from a compact antenna are amalgamated to emulate a significantly larger antenna, thereby delivering data with enhanced resolution.

The table below notes the band with associated frequency, wavelength, and the application typical for that band.

### InSAR

It is mapping for ground movement detected through this phase shift. Movement is shown through an interferogram.

### DInSAR

Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar. It changes between two images in time. Looking at movement of land (uplift or sinking) with topography removed.

### Polarization

In remote sensing, polarization refers to the orientation of the oscillation of electromagnetic waves during propagation. The direction of oscillation of electromagnetic waves can vary between the vertical and horizontal planes, a property known as polarization. Polarization states contains horizontal polarization (H), vertical polarization (V), or cross-polarization (HV or VH). (Jensen, 2007)

## Application

I learned about a method for mapping and monitoring forest biomass in NASA's SAR Handbook. It discusses the use of remote sensing, particularly SAR sensors at long wavelengths, for their sensitivity to Above Ground Biomass (AGB) and their capability to quantify and monitor carbon stocks effectively at a scale relevant to human activities.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk9/biomass _allometric_models.png')
```

Instances of allometric models for biomass derived from lidar data illustrate the process of translating airborne lidar observations into Above Ground Biomass (AGB). The diversity among these models indicates that focusing solely on a single parameter could lead to considerable variations in outcomes for different types of forests, akin to the variability observed in terrestrial allometric models.

Images from UAVSAR L-band polarimetry and polarization metrics over the La Selva Biological Station in the tropical forests of Costa Rica depict: (a) a composite color image using three polarization channels, highlighting regions of largely undisturbed rainforest spanning a mountainous area, with zones of lower biomass detected in the northern and southern extents of the imagery. (b) An image of the Radar Vegetation Index (RVI), where regions with denser forest biomass are marked in red, whereas agricultural lands, agroforestry, and regenerating forests appear in shades of green and blue. (c) An image of the Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI), which distinguishes the more pristine forests in deep blue from areas experiencing degradation, secondary growth, and lower biomass, depicted in lighter shades of blue, green, and red.

## Reflection

-   The processing of SAR data at a lower level has historically presented a challenge due to the intricate and time-consuming preprocessing steps involved.

-   SAR images inherently contain speckle noise, which requires improvement in image quality through multi-looking processing and other despeckling techniques. Radiometric and terrain corrections also need to be applied to SAR data to eliminate errors caused by terrain undulations and changes in the angle of radar signal propagation.

## Dictionary

-   SAR: Synthetic Aperture Radar. which is an active radar system that emits microwave signals and receives signals reflected back from targets to obtain images and information of the Earth's surface or other target objects.

-   Radar pulse: the brief electromagnetic wave pulse emitted by a radar system.

-   EMR wave: Electromagnetic Radiation Wave.

-   Backscatter: The process where some of the energy from the signal emitted by the radar is scattered by a target object and returns to the radar receiver.

-   DEM: Digital Elevation Model. It is used to describe the elevation information of the Earth's surface, excluding artificial or natural objects on the surface such as buildings, trees, etc.

-   DSM: Digital Surface Model. It describes the elevation information of all surface objects (e.g., buildings, trees, mountains) as well as the surface itself, including the elevation of all objects on the surface.

-   DTM: Digital Terrain Model. It is a more precise terrain model that describes the shape, elevation, and terrain below the surface.
