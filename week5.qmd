## Summary

This week, I mainly focus on Heat Island, as well as Extracting temperature from satellite data. Urban heat island (UHI) refers to a localized area within a city or metropolitan area that experiences significantly higher temperatures compared to its surrounding rural areas. It primarily stems from more defined dark surfaces and less vegetation in urban areas. The urban heat island poses challenges to residents' health, energy supply, economic development, and other aspects.

Currently, global policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions are being implemented to control global warming. The UN has developed the Beat the Heat Handbook to provide guidance measures for cities worldwide. During the class, various UHI reduction activities in different cities were introduced. Planting trees is one of the initiatives adopted by various cities, and remote sensing can assist us in identifying areas suitable for greening.

Remote sensing obtains surface temperatures through various sensors and techniques. One of them is using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing. It utilizes the thermal radiation emitted from the Earth's surface to acquire temperature information. Thermal infrared sensors measure thermal radiation in different wavelength ranges and infer surface.

## Application

### Practical

In landsat 8 SR_B. represents Surface Reflectance bands, ST_B.\* represents Thermal bands. Thermal bands typically include one or more bands used to measure surface temperature, such as ST_B10.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk5/landsat_temp.png')

```

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center', cache=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics('image/wk5/modis_temp.png')

```

The spatial resolution of MODIS is relatively low, typically ranging from 250 meters to 1 kilometer, making it suitable for monitoring large-scale surface temperature changes. Landsat, on the other hand, has a higher spatial resolution, typically ranging from 30 meters to 100 meters, making it suitable for monitoring surface temperature changes in smaller areas. MODIS has a higher temporal resolution, typically providing data daily, whereas Landsat has a lower temporal resolution, typically providing data every few days to weeks. Due to its higher temporal resolution and suitability for large-scale spatial resolution, MODIS is commonly used in fields such as global climate change monitoring, environmental monitoring, and weather forecasting. Landsat's higher spatial resolution makes it more suitable for fine-scale surface temperature monitoring and surface feature identification, commonly used in areas such as land use/land cover change, urban planning, and resource management.

```

### Casa study: 

Saputra (2022) focused on the investigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect in Jakarta, Indonesia, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study utilized remote sensing imagery from Landsat 8 to extract land surface temperatures and employed various methodologies for calculating UHI, including radiance conversion, brightness temperature, land surface emissivity, and correlation analysis with COVID-19 case distributions.

## Reflection

Weather Forecast

-   When it come to weather forecasting. Every city has a forecasted temperature, but for large cities, there can be temperature differences across different areas. By leveraging machine learning on remote sensing temperatures and forecasted temperatures, we can obtain more detailed temperature predictions for different regions within the city.

Urban Planning

-   I am also contemplating on urban planning. People have various orientations in urban plannin but currently, temperature is less considered in the initial design phase. Through machine learning, we can predict the future temperature of the built space after implementing different planning methods, in order to choose suitable methods to reduce the urban heat island effect.

Research use

-   Just like what Saputra did, we can obtain urban temperature data through remote sensing and then analyze it together with other data.

Limitations

-   Despite the unparalleled advantages of satellite images to explore the SUHI. Remotely-sensed LST is completely different from air temperature in terms of observation principles and altitudes, which makes SUHI not directly comparable to air UHI. (Zhou, 2019)
