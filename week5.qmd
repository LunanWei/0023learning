## Summary

This week, the focus was mainly on Heat Island, covering topics such as Temperature and policy, as well as Extracting temperature from satellite data. Urban heat island (UHI) refers to a localized area within a city or metropolitan area that experiences significantly higher temperatures compared to its surrounding rural areas. It primarily stems from more defined dark surfaces and less vegetation in urban areas. The urban heat island poses challenges to residents' health, energy supply, economic development, and other aspects.

Currently, global policies aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions are being implemented to control global warming. The UN has developed the Beat the Heat Handbook to provide guidance measures for cities worldwide. During the class, various UHI reduction activities in different cities were introduced. Planting trees is one of the initiatives adopted by various cities, and remote sensing can assist us in identifying areas suitable for greening.

Remote sensing obtains surface temperatures through various sensors and techniques. One of them is using Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing. It utilizes the thermal radiation emitted from the Earth's surface to acquire temperature information. Thermal infrared sensors measure thermal radiation in different wavelength ranges and infer surface.

## Application

In landsat 8 SR_B. represents Surface Reflectance bands, ST_B.\* represents Thermal bands. Thermal bands typically include one or more bands used to measure surface temperature, such as ST_B10.

```

MODIS的空间分辨率相对较低，通常在250米至1公里之间，适合用于监测大范围的地表温度变化。Landsat的空间分辨率相对较高，通常在30米至100米之间，适合用于监测较小范围内的地表温度变化。MODIS具有较高的时间分辨率，通常每天都会提供数据.Landsat的时间分辨率较低，通常几天至几周提供一次数据.由于其较高的时间分辨率和适用于大范围的空间分辨率，MODIS常用于全球气候变化监测、环境监测和天气预测等领域。Landsat的较高空间分辨率使其更适合用于精细尺度的地表温度监测和地表特征识别，常用于土地利用/土地覆盖变化、城市规划和资源管理等领域。

## Reflection

Weather Forecast

-   When it come to weather forecasting. Every city has a forecasted temperature, but for large cities, there can be temperature differences across different areas. By leveraging machine learning on remote sensing temperatures and forecasted temperatures, we can obtain more detailed temperature predictions for different regions within the city.

Urban Planning

-   I am also contemplating on urban planning. People have various orientations in urban plannin but currently, temperature is less considered in the initial design phase. Through machine learning, we can predict the future temperature of the built space after implementing different planning methods, in order to choose suitable methods to reduce the urban heat island effect.
